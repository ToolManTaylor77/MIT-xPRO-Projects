# MIT-xPRO-Projects
This is where I'll be storing all of my class project reference JS code.
There is no installation of any files or programs necessarey to view and edit the JavaScript sample files in this folder location.
You are free to use the sample code in whole or in part without any permissions required.
The JavaScript code contained in this folder should not require any support as I am not the creator of this content.  Use the internet or AI tools available to help analyze any code issues.
Thanks, and Have A Great Day!
